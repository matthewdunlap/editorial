The workflow is forked from [Insert Image... ](http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5896882052136960/tbnRcIh3c38) written by [@pastrunho](http://twitter.com/pastrunho). The code for orientation was found in post from [scabbiaza](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1350976/scabbiaza) on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13872331/rotating-an-image-with-orientation-specified-in-exif-using-python-without-pil-in). Putting it together and any other modifications and/or creations of code come from me.
